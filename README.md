# Managing Local File Permissions in Windows Environment

## Introduction
This project demonstrates my hands-on experience in managing file and folder permissions in a Windows environment. It details the process of managing user accounts and local file/folder permissions on a Windows 11 virtual.

This task was completed in response to a training ticket assigned during my hands-on Practical Help Desk course with LevelEffect. The goal was to remove administrators priviledge of a user by making the user's account a regular one and to also deny the user access to a file (salary.txt) saved in the Windows 11 local Disk (C:).

## Lessons Learnt
Through this project, I learned how easily inherited permissions can expose sensitive files if not properly managed. I also deepened my understanding of how Deny permissions take precedence. This exercise reinforced my understanding of the principle of least privilege and its real-world application.
